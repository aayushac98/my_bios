<h1>My Interests</h1>
<body>
    <main>
<p>We all loves different flavor. Similarly, we all have wide ranges of interests and hobbies. I like spending quality time with my family
members which strengthen our bond. I like travelling a lot as it helps me to grow as an individual. I've a habit of reading novels, cycling,
playing cricket, collecting different countries currencies, watching movies and so on. I want a peace allround and am a nature-lover.
I like to being around trees, birds, waterfalls, hills and other natural heritages. As nature is a source of peace, we have to take a good care
of it. It is the true remedy for stress and tiredness. It keeps me energized. Also, I have a keen interest in computer and gadgets since my
childhood. I too like being around machines and wanna know their structure, components and how they work. I am a thiest.</p>
